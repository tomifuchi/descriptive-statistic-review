This is the description of the dataset straight from the source

Summary
Human Height and Weight are mostly hereditable, but lifestyles, diet, health
and environmental factors also play a role in determining individual's physical
characteristics. The dataset below contains 25,000 synthetic records of human
heights and weights of 18 years old children. 

These data were simulated based on a 1993 by a Growth Survey of 25,000 children
from birth to 18 years of age recruited from Maternal and Child Health Centres
(MCHC) and schools and were used to develop Hong Kong's current growth charts
for weight, height, weight-for-age, weight-for-height and body mass index
(BMI). See also the Major League Baseball Players Height and Weight dataset. 

My word:
This is simulated, synthetic, this is not real. But...Good for practicing with large data I guess.
Not that large, large these days are in the TB's not even Gigs no more.
